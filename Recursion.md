#Recursion

Recursion is a technique by which a method makes one or more calls to itself during execution, or by which a data structure relies upon smaller instances of the very same type of structure in its representation.

### Some Examples of Recursion

1. There are many examples of recursion in art and nature. For example, fractal patterns are naturally recursive.

2. The factorial function (denoted as n!) has a natural recursive definition in Mathematics.

3. The English Ruler has a recursive pattern, that is a simple example of a fractal structure.

4. Binary Search, allows us to efficiently locate a desired value in a data set with upwards of billions of entries.

5. The File system for a computer has a recursive structure in which directories can be nested arbitrarily deeply within other directories. Recursive algorithms are widely used to explore and manage these file systems.
